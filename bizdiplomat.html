Collection of Personal Information:

The Site’s registration form requires users to give us contact information (such as name, phone number and email address) and demographic information (such as postal code, or income level) and other information that is used by us to provide services. We use the customer contact information from the registration form to send the user information that he or she has requested regarding the Site or regarding services offered by us. This Site uses an ad form for customers to place online ads. One of the express purposes of the Site is to gather contact information provided voluntarily by customers to be published online, as the case may be, and in connection with products/services that are for sale/wanted by users. We have no control over who views online ads. Contact information provided may be used to contact customers when necessary. We collect customers financial information (such as account or credit card numbers) to bill the user for products and services, but retain this information only as required to process the transaction and for as long as may be required by law.

Demographic and profile data is also collected at the Site. We use this data to tailor each visitor’s experience at the Site, showing the user content that we think he or she might be interested in, and displaying the content according to the user’s preferences.

Our online surveys ask visitors for contact information (such as email addresses) and demographic information (such as postal code, or income level). We use contact data from our surveys to send users information about our products and services. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings.

We may use customer information for additional purposes that may be identified at or before the time that the information is collected. We also use information from customers for accounting and transaction completion purposes.
